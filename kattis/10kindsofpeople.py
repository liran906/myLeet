'''
The algorithm above is TOTALLY ABLE TO SOLVE THE QUESTION, however upon subbmission, the 23rd test case won't pass, 
with 'runtime error' indicated. I think it's because of exceeding max recrusion depth, or multiple calculations
on the same maze (because of multiple start & end location sets).
Given this, with the help of gpt, came up with this new algorithm below: flood-fill.
it calculates the maze once, and returns the expected result base on that.
